# Credit-risk-Im-balancing

This module is exploring a dataset for a lending company.

It uses a Logistic Regression model of machine learning to train on that data and predict the risk of clients defaulting on loans.


Default ratios are inherently low within lending data for successful companies so the data is imbalanced but that small risky sector is the target to be

identified and reduced further with as much reliability as possible.


The machine learning model is run in its basic form and then run with a resampled method of Random oversampling for a comparison

The data is historical so it has a reference point to calculate the accuracy of the models used and their predictions.


The logistic Regression model is a classification algorithm ideal for working with binary outputs such as 'default or not' as required in this case

Both models perform well but in this instance the resampled version has an edge.
